Motion Tracking in Video:

Motion tracking is a visual effects technique used to track the movement of objects or people in a video clip. By analyzing the motion of specific points or areas frame by frame, software can follow their path and apply visual elements that stay aligned with the motion. This technique is commonly used to insert graphics, text, or 3D elements that follow a moving subject, stabilize shaky footage, or blur moving objects like faces or license plates.
